DocTR provides an easy and powerful way to extract valuable information from your documents:

* |:receipt:| **for automation**: seemlessly process documents for Natural Language Understanding tasks: we provide OCR predictors to parse textual information (localize and identify each word) from your documents.
* |:woman_scientist:| **for research**: quickly compare your own architectures speed & performances with state-of-art models on public datasets.


Main Features
-------------

* |:robot:| Robust 2-stage (detection + recognition) OCR predictors with pretrained parameters
* |:zap:| User-friendly, 3 lines of code to load a document and extract text with a predictor
* |:rocket:| State-of-the-art performances on public document datasets, comparable with GoogleVision/AWS Textract
* |:zap:| Optimized for inference speed on both CPU & GPU
* |:bird:| Light package, minimal dependencies
* |:tools:| Actively maintained by Mindee
* |:factory:| Easy integration (available templates for browser demo & API deployment)
